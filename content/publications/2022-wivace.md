### Abstract

The ability to adapt to changes and unexpected situations is a commonly acknowledged hallmark of autonomy and intelligence.
In this work we take inspiration from biology for the definition of a robot able to continuously adapt to changes.
Specifically, we define its control structure and the mechanism used to perform the adaptation.
The former is based on the _Reservoir Computing_ framework, on which the latter acts.
The result is the design of an Online Adaptive Reservoir Computing system based on a novel memristive reservoir: the _Nanowire Network_.
Finally, the robot is tested on three different tasks taking place in different arenas.
The results are then discussed and compared with a baseline algorithm.
